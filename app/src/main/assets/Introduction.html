                Data management comprises all the disciplines related to managing data as a valuable resource.
                <br><br>
                The concept of "<strong class="bold">Data Management</strong>" arose in the 1980s as technology moved from sequential processing (first cards, then tape) to random access processing.
                <br><br>
                Since it was now technically possible to store a single fact in a single place and access that using random access disk, those suggesting that "<strong class="bold">Data Management</strong>" was more important than "<strong>Process Management</strong>" used arguments such as "<strong class="bold">a customer's home address is stored in 75 ( or more other large number) places in computer systems.</strong>"
                <br><br>
                During this preiod, random access processing was not competitively fast, "<strong class="bold">Process Management</strong>" was more important than "<strong class="bold">Data Management</strong>" used batch processing times as their primary argument.
                <br><br>
                As applications moved more and more into real-time, interactive applications, it became obvious to most practitioners that both management processes were important. If the data was not well defined, the data would be mis-used in applications. If the process was'nt well defined, it was impossible to meet user needs.

            <h4 class="head">USAGE</h4>
            <p class="flow-text font">
                In mordern management usage, one can easily discern a trend away from the term '<strong class="bold">data</strong>' in composite expressions to the term information or even knowledge when walking in non-technical context.
